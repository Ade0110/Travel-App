Introduction:
For my capstone project, I created a simple travel app. The user enters a postcode of a place they would like to visit and they can see information such as the city name, temperature, weather description and also a picture of the city. Three APIs were called in order to get these information. The APIs used are Geonames, Weatherbit and Pixabay.


Technology:
The technologies I used to create this app are Html, Scss, Javasctipt, Nodejs, Webpack and Jest.


How to run the project:
The project can be ran in 2 modes, development and production. 
To run in development mode: run npm run build-dev in the terminal.
To run in production mode: run npm run build-prod.
